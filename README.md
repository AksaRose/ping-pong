# ping-pong
A simple Ping Pong game implemented in Python using the *turtle* module. This project simulates a classic Pong game with two paddles and a ball, allowing two players to control the paddles using keyboard inputs. It's a fun way to understand the basics of game development and the turtle module in Python.
## How it Works ?
This project creates a Ping Pong game where two players can control their respective paddles using keyboard inputs. The ball moves automatically and bounces off the paddles and the window boundaries. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle.
